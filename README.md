# architecture-style-detection
This project is dedicated to the development of an advanced AI model that excels at detecting architectural styles. The model has undergone rigorous training on a diverse dataset consisting of 10,000 high-quality images encompassing 25 different architectural styles. These images have been carefully selected from the renowned Kaggle architectural style database (accessible at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dumitrux/architectural-styles-dataset).

Please note that, due to GitHub's file size regulations, the model's .pth file and the complete image dataset could not be uploaded. However, this repository provides comprehensive code and detailed instructions for training and evaluating the model, enabling easy reproduction and further development.

By leveraging cutting-edge deep learning techniques, this architecture style detection model exhibits remarkable accuracy and robustness. It holds significant potential for various applications, including architectural analysis, historic preservation, and interior design. The project's comprehensive documentation and insightful code make it an exceptional resource for recruiters and professionals interested in AI-driven architecture solutions.
