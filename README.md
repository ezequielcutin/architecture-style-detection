# architecture-style-detection
This project focuses on developing an AI model for detecting architectural styles. The model has been trained on a dataset comprising 10,000 images of 25 different architectural styles sourced from the Kaggle architectural style database (available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dumitrux/architectural-styles-dataset).

Please note that the model's .pth file and the entire image dataset cannot be uploaded to GitHub due to file size restrictions imposed by the platform. However, the code and instructions for training and evaluating the model are provided in this repository.
